## Usage

Alright. So, assuming you already cloned/downloaded the Repo and you have Killing Floor installed via **steamCMD** as a dedicated server.

- Navigate to your local KF-Dedicated Server directory
- Replace all files when prompted (Except `Killingfloor.ini`)

Now we need to update the '*Vanilla*' Settings to what **YOU** want

- Open **Killingfloor.ini** with a file editor (Preferably *VSCode* or *NotePad++*)
- Press Cntrl+F (To Find a keyword)
- Search for '**Change_me**' (Without the quotes)
  - Whenever you find a Change_me keyword, replace it with what you want :)
  - Replace *or* add all other values that are present in `Killingfloor.ini` from this repo, into the default `Killingfloor.ini`
- Now look for **KF_Server_Launcher.bat** in **\System**
  - Right click and create a desktop shortcut for it

### Disabling/Enabling Mutators

Navigate to `MutLoader.ini`:

- Change the configs to whatever you want. Each config works according to the GameDifficulty votes from your MapVotes
  - Here you can enable/disable mutators
  - Here you can change your ServerName with every MapVote you do. For more, check [MutLoader v2.1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2286683680)

You are done! Launch Killing Floor from steam, once it loads, launch the newly created **KF_Server_Launcher** shortcut from your desktop. You should be able to view the server once it starts inside the game.

You can join your own server, and if you have all ports properly forwarded in your router, anyone can join you!
