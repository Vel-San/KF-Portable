# KF-PORTABLE

A pre-configured, Whitelisted *dedicated-server* **/system** directory for Killing Floor 1

This guide assumes that you are already familiar with setting up a dedicated server via '**steamCMD**', if not, then you can simply contact me using the following:

- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vel-San/)
- Discord: **.Vel-San.#7468**
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vel__San)

## What is included

This directory is tailored according to my own taste of mutators, which is **Whitelisted** if run as a *dedicated* server.
I did not change any settings of the actual game, just edited things like:

### Vanilla Changes

- Server Name (Can be changed to what you want)
- VAC Secured
- Edited parameters to allow downloading of Muts as compressed
- Changed the NAT value
- Changed default launch options of the server (Can be Changed to what you want)
- Added my own FTP server to FastDownloads

### Mutator Changes

I currently have 2 lists of mutators in my Steam Collections:

- Not-Whitelisted, Minimal must-have muts that will improve player experience (Affects gameplay in several ways)
  - [Found Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1913521033)
- Whitelisted, Minimal must-have muts that do not affect your gameplay, rather just imrpove Quality of the game
  - [Found Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1490172785)
